We have entered our emissions from the past seven years, which the tool neatly presents in a graph form, showing how we have been doing over those years. It really hits home to see we have made real progress as a company in reducing our carbon footprint. <br></br> In this tool, we can add our information and get instant feedback presented in a chart. It shows us if we are going in the right direction when looking at carbon emissions, or if we need to do more. Thankfully, we have been monitoring this for seven years, so we have had plans in place to reduce our emissions which the graph shows."
