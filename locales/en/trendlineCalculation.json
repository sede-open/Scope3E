Please note that any information arising from the future emissions trendline is not conclusive and should not be treated as a prediction or recommendation or advice from example. Please note that we do not provide any form of advisory and/or consultancy services to you and/or your company. example also does not provide assurance or guarantee that information arising from the future emissions trendline is accurate.",
  "paragraphs[1]": "The results of the future emission trendline depend on the assumption that the situation in the future remains relatively similar to the current and/or past situation. Therefore, any major changes that may affect your company’s CO2e emissions, such as shifts in the macro-economic conditions or significant adjustments in the business activities of your company, could have a substantial effect on the actual CO2e emissions. The estimated trendline cannot account for such situations. The polynomial regression is simply a possible trajectory of your company’s CO2e emissions based on the historical records and information that you have uploaded on the Hub.",
  "paragraphs[2]": "We may introduce new techniques and tools from time to time to improve trendline calculation."
